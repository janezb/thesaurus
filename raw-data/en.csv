Late Middle English via Old French from Arabic zaytūnī ‘of Tsinkiang’, a town in China.A basic binding system or weave structure in which the threads of the warp are caught and looped by the weft only at certain intervals. It is based on a unit of five or more ends and a number of picks equal to, or a multiple of, the number of ends. Each end either passes over four or more adjacent picks and under the next one, or the contrary, under four or more adjacent picks and over the next one. Units of six do not work mathematically. It has a surface of long floats, which reflects light when woven, bound in a systematic way but whose binding is not readily visible. The main or front surface of a satin weave is the face on which the warps form the floats.","CIETA. Burnham, Dorothy. Warp and Weft. A Textile Terminology. Royal Ontario Museum, 1980. Phipps, Elena.

238,Sarga,,238,Twill,,,"n. Middle English from a Scots and northern English variant of obsolete twilly, from Old English twi- ‘two’, suggested by Latin bilix ‘two-threaded’.  A basic binding system, woven as to have a surface of diagonal parallel ridges. The binding points are set over by one end on successive picks and form diagonal lines.Sequential threads skip or float over one or more interlacements in a diagonal alignment, forming a unit with no less than three warps and three wefts. Each end passes over two or more adjacent picks and under the next one or more, or under two or more adjacent picks and over the next one or more. The binding points are set over by one end on successive picks. The repeat of a twill is described according to the number of warps and wefts that float in sequence, such as 2/2, 3/1, or 1/2, etc. The bar used between the numbers indicates the direction of the twill diagonal, but the bar / is used also without any implication. If it is needed a more definite annotation of the twill direction the addition of the letters S or Z could be used.","CIETA. Burnham, Dorothy. Warp and Weft. A Textile Terminology.
