168,Damasco ,,168,Damask,,"A self-pattemed weave with one warp and one weft in which the pattern is formed by a contrast of binding systems. In its classic form it is reversible, and the contrast is produced by the use of the warp and weft faces of the same weave, usually satin. By extension this terrn is also used for weaves in which two distinct binding systems are employed. In its classic form damask patterning is produced by contrasting the two faces of a satin weave. This suggests a shiny warp-faced satín pattem against an equally shiny weft-faced satin ground, with the exact reverse on the other face. Most silk damasks are of unbalanced weave with a fine, closely set warp producing a shiny warp face and a heavier, more widely spaced weft giving quite a dull appearance in the a reas where the weft predominates. This is obvious in the diagram and also in the two silk damasks shown below. Linen damasks for table use are usually of balanced weave and completely reversible.","A self-pattemed weave with one warp and one weft in which the pattern is formed by a contrast of binding systems. In its classic form it is reversible, and the contrast is produced by the use of the warp and weft faces of the same weave, usually satin. By extension this terrn is also used for weaves in which two distinct binding systems are employed. In its classic form damask patterning is produced by contrasting the two faces of a satin weave. This suggests a shiny warp-faced satín pattem against an equally shiny weft-faced satin ground, with the exact reverse on the other face.

With the heddle rods of simple looms, the heddles are usually tied on the warp each time the loom is set up. A long piece of cord is looped around the heddle rod and around each warp end that it is to control in tum. The method of looping varíes according to culture. On a shaft loom, the heddles are suspended between upper and lower bars and usually consist of loops that go over the bars with a small fixed loop in the middle, the eye, through which the warp end is threaded. For certain purposes the eye may be quite long. Clasped heddles consist of two loops which go over the bars and clasp each other in the centre. An end may be threaded above the clasp for a rising shed or below for a sinking shed, or in sorne cases through the centre of the clasp. Netted heddles are sets of joined heddles tied from a continuous thread and spaced appropriately for a specific type of weave. On a drawloom, the heddles, called leashes, are suspended from the necking cords below the comber board. 2. Term used to distinguish the heddle of a drawloom.
